/*
 * LeetCode Problem 25: Reverse Nodes in k-Group
 * Difficulty: Hard
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes in groups of size 'k',
 * and return the modified linked list.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - 'k' is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list.
 * - If the number of nodes is not a multiple of 'k', the remaining nodes at the end should remain unchanged.
 * - The values in the nodes cannot be alteredâ€”only the nodes themselves may be rearranged.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
 * Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
 * Explanation: Nodes are reversed in pairs.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
 * Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
 * Explanation: The first three nodes are reversed, but the last two remain unchanged.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the list is 'n'.
 * - 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
 * - 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 *
 * Follow-up:
 * - Can you solve the problem using O(1) extra memory space?
