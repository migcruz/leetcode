/*
 * LeetCode Problem 104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
 * Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
 *
 * The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest 
 * path from the root down to the farthest leaf node.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest path is from node 3 to node 7, passing through three nodes.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [1,null,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest path contains two nodes (1 â†’ 2).
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
